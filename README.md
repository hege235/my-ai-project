# My AI Project

## Summary

This project aims to predict cabin prices based on features like size, sauna size, distance to water, number of bathrooms, and proximity to neighbors. 
The AI method used is linear regression, and the goal is to help cabin owners estimate fair market prices for their properties.

## Data

The project uses data about cabins, including:
- Size of the cabin (m²)
- Size of the sauna (m²)
- Distance to water (meters)
- Number of indoor bathrooms
- Proximity of neighbors

## Method

Linear regression is applied to estimate cabin prices based on the given features. 
The coefficients are calculated using the least squares method, allowing prediction of prices for new cabins.
